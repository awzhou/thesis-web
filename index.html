			<p class="maintext">The <i>oskar</i> gene encodes an RNA and protein, both of which are highly localized 
				within the developing oocyte and embryo and play important roles in <i>Drosophila</i> development. 
				<i>osk</i> mRNA is localized to the posterior of the oocyte where it is translated into Oskar protein, 
				which serves as the nucleator of germ granules within a specialized cytoplasm known as the germ 
				plasm. These germ granules, which contain factors important to germline specification and 
				development, are later incorporated into the primordial germ cells, known as pole cells in 
				<i>Drosophila</i>. <i>osk</i> also has a noncoding function in the oocyte that is crucial for progression beyond 
				the early stages of oogenesis. This noncoding function is mediated by the 3’ untranslated region, 
				which contains several sequences in the so-called C region that are necessary for oogenesis 
				progression. Various RNA-binding proteins, including Bruno, which suppresses translation of 
				unlocalized <i>osk</i>, are known to bind to this region to contribute to <i>osk</i> noncoding function, but it 
				is likely that others remain to be identified. Here, I identify a candidate gene that may have 
				roles in <i>osk</i> noncoding function. Results from egg-laying assays and RNA immunoprecipitation 
				experiments suggest that the RNA-binding protein Zinc finger protein at 72D (Zn72D) binds to osk 
				RNA and contributes to its noncoding function. Zn72D also appears to play a role in the posterior 
				localization of <i>osk</i> mRNA as shown in single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization and 
				RT-qPCR experiments with Zn72D knockdown flies. Knockdown of Zn72D continues to have effects later 
				in the development of the germline. This is indicated in an <i>oskar-sfgfp</i> background by a decrease 
				in the number of pole cells seen using immunohistochemical staining, which is consistent with the 
				observed decrease in <i>oskar</i> posterior localization. This thesis proposes that Zn72D is a novel 
				factor in both the non-coding function of <i>oskar</i> RNA and the localization of <i>oskar</i> mRNA to the 
				posterior — where it is translated into Oskar protein — providing the groundwork for a deeper 
				understanding of how the germline is specified.</p>
